    We have seen in the previous post the patterns made by the the tangents of certain parametric lines. This is a
    follow-up on that post and we will look at the same closed figures by plotting normals to them.

<hr>

<p>Definition: The simplest description of a normal is that it is a line segment perpendicular to the curve or the
    surface at the point where it is rooted. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_(geometry)">This is the
        Wikipedia link</a>.

<p>If you have a two-dimensional curve defined by the parametric equations x = x(t) and y = y(t)</p>

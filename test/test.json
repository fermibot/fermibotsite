    "Why We Sleep": {
      "Stick to a sleep schedule": "We should aim to go to bed and wake up at the same time each day. People generally have a hard time adjusting to changes in sleep patterns. Unfortunately sleeping late on weekends doesn’t make up for poor sleep during the week. If necessary, set an alarm for bedtime. Matthew emphasizes this is the #1 priority from the list; stick to a regular sleep schedule",
      "Don’t exercise too late in the day": "Exercise is great, and we should try to exercise at least 30 minutes on most days. But try to time it no later than 2-3 hours before bed",
      "Avoid caffeine & nicotine": "Colas, coffee, teas (that aren’t herbal), and chocolate contain caffeine, which is a stimulant. Even consuming these in the afternoon can have an effect on your sleep. Nicotine is also a mild stimulant, and smokers will often wake up earlier than they would otherwise, due to nicotine withdrawal",
      "Avoid alcoholic drinks before bed": "The presence of alcohol in the body can reduce your REM sleep, keeping you in the lighter stages of sleep",
      "Avoid large meals and beverages late at night": "A light snack before bed is okay, but a heavy meal can cause digestive issues, which interferes with sleep. Drinking too many fluids can cause frequent awakenings to urinate",
      "Avoid medicines that delay or disrupt your sleep (where possible)": "Some commonly prescribed heart, blood pressure, or asthma medications, as well as some over-the-counter and herbal medicines for coughs, colds, or allergies, can disrupt sleep patterns. If you have trouble sleeping, it may be worth speaking to your doctor or pharmacist to see if any of the drugs you’re taking may be contributing to this. It may be possible to take them earlier in the day",
      "Don’t nap after 3 pm": "Naps are great, but taking them too late in the day can make it hard to fall asleep at night",
      "Make sure to leave time to relax before bed": "It’s important to have time before bed to unwind. Try to schedule your days so that there is time to relax before bed",
      "Take a hot bath before bed": "The drop in body temperature after a bath may help you to feel sleepy, and the bath can help you to slow down and relax before bed",
      "Have a dark, cool (in temperature), gadget-free bedroom": "",
      "Get the right sunlight exposure": "Sun exposure during the day helps us to regulate sleeping patterns. Try to get outside in the natural sunlight for at least 30 minutes per day",
      "Don’t stay in bed if you (really) can’t sleep": "If you find yourself still in bed for more than 20 minutes, or you’re starting to get anxious in bed, get up and do something else until you feel sleepy. Anxiety whilst trying to sleep can make it harder to fall asleep."

    <strong>Mathematical Art:</strong> I started off this site in 2013 as a blog to showcase some Mathematical Art which
    I did using Wolfram Mathematica. I have published 'Art' related posts until about the beginning of the year 2017. My
    interest later on drifted towards Probability, Statistics and Simulation and started creating more pages related to
    the illustration of the concepts.

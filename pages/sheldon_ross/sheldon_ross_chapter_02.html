            <p><strong>Example 2.9</strong> Suppose that a particular trait of a person (such as eye color or left
                handedness) is classified on the basis of one pair of genes and suppose that d represents a dominant
                gene and r a recessive gene. Thus a person with dd genes is pure dominance, one with rr is pure
                recessive, and one with rd is hybrid. The pure dominance and the hybrid are alike in appearance.

            <p><strong>Exercise 3.74</strong> There are five components. The components act independently, with
                component \(i\) working with probability \(p_{i}: i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\). These components form a system
                as shown in Figure below. The system is said to work if a signal originating at the left end of the
                diagram can reach the right end, where it can pass through a component only if that component is
                working. (For instance, if components 1 and 4 both work, then the system also works.) What is the
                probability that the system works?

<h5>Question</h5>
<p>In the match problem of Example 2.31 involving \(n\), \(n > 1\), individuals, find the conditional expected number of
    matches given that the first person did not have a match.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="../../chapter_02/example_02_031/example_02_031.html">Example 2.31</a></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h5>Analytical Solution</h5>

<p>As we see from the the problem’s description, 2.31 has been reiterated with a condition. This can be solved by
    applying the method of the conditional expectations
    \[E[X] = E[E[X|X=x]] ⇒ E[X] = E[X|X_1=0] P\{X_1=0\} + E[X|X_1=1] P\{X_1=1\}\]
</p>

<ul>
    <li>\(E[X] = 1\) (from problem 2.31)</li>
    <li>\(E[X|X1=0]\) is an unknown</li>
    <li>\(P\{X_1=0\} = 1-P\{X_1 \ne 1\} = 1 – \frac{1}{n} = \frac{n-1}{n}\)</li>
    <li>\(E[X|X1=1]\)</li>
    <ul>
        <li> Since the first one is a match and there are n-1 left, the probability of match of each of them is 1⁄n-1
        </li>
        <li>The expected number of matches from the set of n-1 would be then equal to one</li>
        <li>Since the first one is already a match, the quantity \(E[X|X_{1}=1] = 1 + 1 = 2\)</li>
    </ul>
    <li>\(P\{X_{1}=1\} = \frac{1}{n}\) (from problem 2.31)</li>
</ul>
<p>Plugging these in the equality above, we get \(E[X|X_{1}=0] = \frac{n-2}{n-1}\)</p>

<hr>


<h5>Observations</h5>

<ul>
    <li>There is one significant change of the expected value as compared to scenario 2.31.</li>
    <li>In 2.31, the expected value was a constant</li>
    <li>With a condition that the first one is not a match, the probability has become a function of the number of
        items (or hats)
    </li>
    <li>This would give us a variable number of hats to make additional observations in the simulation (which is the
        next section)
    </li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h5>Simulations</h5>
<p>The simulations have been summarized in the chart below. What is being shown in the chart?</p>
<ul>
    <li>Each bar has 1000 points
        <ul>
            <li>each point is mean value of the number of matches for i iterations</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The number of iterations per point can be seen as a number below the bar</li>
    <li>Reading the first bar as an example
        <ul>
            <li>It has number 10 written below it</li>
            <li>This means that each point is the average of 10 values</li>
            <li>Each value is the count of number of matches in a set of alphabets and it has been made sure that that
                first element is not a match (which is a requirement from the problem statement)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Horizontal Bar: If you look closely there is a horizontal bar shown in the chart. This has been kept at 0.96
        <ul>
            <li>Why 0.96? Since the alphabet, has 26 letters, the expected value from theory is \(\frac{26-1}{26-2} =
                0.96\)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h5>Question</h5>
<p>Suppose we are given a set of n distinct values \(x_1, ..., x_{n}\) and we desire to put these values in
    increasing order or, as it is commonly called, to sort them. An efficient procedure for accomplishing this is the
    quick-sort algorithm, which is defined recursively as follows:
<p>

<ul>
    <li>When \(n = 2\) the algorithm compares the two values and puts them in the appropriate order.</li>
    <li>When \(n > 2\) it starts by choosing at random one of the n values say, xi and then compares each of the other
        \(n − 1\)
    </li>
    <li>values with \(x_i\), noting which are smaller and which are larger than \(x_i\).</li>
</ul>

<p>Letting \(S_i\) denote the set of elements smaller than \(x_i\), and \(^{-}S_i\) the set of elements greater than
    \(x_{i}\), the algorithm now sorts the set Si and the set \(^{-}S_i\). The final ordering, therefore, consists of
    the ordered set of the elements in \(S_{i}\), then \(x_{i}\), and then the ordered set of the elements in
    \(^{-}S_{i}\).</p>

<p>For instance, suppose that the set of elements is 10, 5, 8, 2, 1, 4, 7.</p>

<p>We start by choosing one of these values at random (that is, each of the 7 values has probability of \(\frac{1}{7}\)
    of being chosen). Suppose, for instance that the value 4 is chosen.</p>

<ul>
    <li>We then compare 4 with each of the other six values to obtain {2, 1}, 4, {10, 5, 8, 7}</li>
    <li>We now sort the set {2, 1} to obtain 1, 2, 4, {10, 5, 8, 7}</li>
    <li>Next we choose a value at random from {10, 5, 8, 7} say 7 is chosen and compare each of the other three values
        with 7 to obtain 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, {10, 8}
    </li>
    <li>Finally, we sort {10, 8} to end up with 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10</li>
</ul>

The textbook then goes on for nearly two full pages to explain the efficiency to calculate the expected number of
comparisons when the number of elements in the list is \(n\). Please look at it, if you want the detailed derivation.
For this post, I would like to stick to the simulation part.

<hr>

<h5>Pre-Simulation</h5>
<p>This part is just to see if the code is working properly. For the simulation, I have written two
    implementations of Quick-Sort. One in python and another one in Mathematica. I would be using the Python version
    here for the actual sorting and the tracking of the sorting while importing the same file into Mathematica for the
    graphics. Here are 10 instances of a sorting sequence of a randomly sampled sequence of numbers from 1 to 200. Note
    how the selection for each of the instances is random</p>

<p>All the animations are together ~20MB in size, so it till take a while before they all load. Until they fully load
    they might appear nonsensical :) </p>

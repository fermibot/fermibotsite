                airplane engine will fail, when in flight, with probability 1−p independently from engine to engine;
                suppose that the airplane will make a successful flight if at least 50 percent of its engines remain
                operative. For what values of p is a four-engine plane preferable to a two-engine plane?</a></p>

            <h5>Example 2.9</h5>
            <p><a href="http://fermibot.com/sheldon-ross-10-example-2-9/" target="_blank">Suppose that a particular
                trait of a person (such as eye color or left handedness) is classified on the basis of one pair of genes
                and suppose that d represents a dominant gene and r a recessive gene. Thus a person with dd genes is
                pure dominance, one with rr is pure recessive, and one with rd is hybrid. The pure dominance and the
                hybrid are alike in appearance. Children receive one gene from each parent. If, with respect to a
                particular trait, two hybrid parents have a total of four children, what is the probability that exactly
                three of the four children have the outward appearance of the dominant gene?</a></p>

    a particle that moves along a set of m + 1 nodes, labeled 0, 1, . . . ,m, that are arranged around a circle. At each
    step the particle is equally likely to move one position in either the clockwise or counterclockwise direction. That
    is, if X<sub>n</sub> is the position of the particle after its n<sup>th</sup> step then
    P{X<sub>n+1</sub> = i + 1|X<sub>n</sub> = i} = P{X<sub>n+1</sub> = i − 1|X<sub>n</sub> = i} = 1/2 where i + 1 ≡ 0

    that we want to generate a random variable X that is equally likely to be either 0 or 1, and that all we have at our
    disposal is a biased coin that, when flipped, lands on heads with some (unknown) probability p. Consider the
    following procedure:
    1.Flip the coin, and let 01, either heads or tails, be the result
    2.Flip the coin again, and let 02 be the result
    3.If 01 and 02 are the same, return to step 1
    4.If 02 is heads, set X = 0, otherwise set X = 1</a></p>

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The page follows the same pattern as `LifeSkills_HowToTalkToAnyone`:
- Clean, modern interface
- Color-coded sections for easy navigation
- Interactive force-directed graph
- Progress tracking to encourage engagement
- Search and filter for quick access
- Mobile-first responsive design

---

## ✨ Unique Aspects

Unlike the "How to Talk to Anyone" page which focuses on communication techniques, this page emphasizes:
- **Philosophy over tactics** - Core principles vs specific techniques
- **Mental models** - Frameworks for thinking differently
- **Daily practices** - Actionable habits to implement
- **Counterintuitive wisdom** - Challenging conventional self-help advice

The visualization structure reflects Manson's philosophy:
- Fewer, more meaningful concepts (36 vs 92)
- Emphasis on depth over breadth
- Focus on what matters (choosing values)
- Acceptance of struggle and failure
- Reality-based, controllable principles

---

- All content respects the book's core message
- Summaries are concise but comprehensive
- Relationships between concepts are meaningful

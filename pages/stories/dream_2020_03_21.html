    <h4>Author's Note</h4>
    <p>This incident happened in my grandparents’ previous house. This house is part of an apartment complex with an
        unconventional style of construction. The house is a single column of rooms attached to the other. The entrance
        faces the street. As you enter the house, you can guide yourself by walking straight through all the 4 rooms
        until you are in the backyard. The backyard faces a tributary of a river which is about 100 feet in width. This
        width, however, is also dependent on the time of the day. There are several other columnar houses next to
        ours.</p>
    <hr>

    <h4>The Incident(s)</h4>
    <pre>October 31, 1978</pre>
    <p>We all gathered in the house for what seems to be like an impromptu meeting. There were
          all my cousins (and their parents) from Mom’s side and Grandma’s sister and her husband. The TV was on full
        volume and everyone in the house all ears.</p>

    <p>Anchor: The seismologists say that the ebbs and tides will continue to be erratic until the moon stabilizes its
        orbit. We have with us in the studio Dr. Morris. So, Dr. Morris what is your outlook on the events that are
        unfolding across the world. </p>

    <p> Anchor: Very interesting Doctor. It is hard to believe asteroid that has stuck the moon has caused so much
        damage in the long term. Especially given the fact that there has been no direct impact on the earth of any
        post-collision debris from either the moon or the rock that hit it.</p>

    <p> Dr. Morris: Yes Jenna. It is true that the effects seem otherworldly but I would like to urge the viewers and
        television hosts like yourself to exercise scientific temper in these matters. Let us not go to soothsayers or
        Neo-Nostradamuses for guidance. Our scientists across the world are working exceedingly longer shifts by the day
        and all their efforts focussed on finding the truth.</p>

    <p> Anchor: It is easier said than done, Doctor. The reports from the field are breathtakingly surreal. Just an hour
        ago, a new incident has been radioed in. The wolfpacks on the southern Atlantic coast are migrating northeast.
        On their way, they are savaging on all the other animals (large and small alike). They found many dismembered
        carcasses of full-grown male Kodiaks which weigh more than 1100 pounds. And that is not even the half of it.
        These are warm climate wolves! Why would they rum themselves to the freezing temperatures? Some have even made
        their way to Nunavut (one of the northernmost provinces of Canada).</p>

    <p> Dr. Morris: Jenna! you must not scare the viewers with unverified data. I am repeating myself in saying that
        there is always a scientific explanation for everything.</p>

    <p> Anchor: I do not think that science is useful enough after the incident.</p>

    <p> Dr. Morris: Frankly, this attitude of the program is unnerving. I have other important places to be. See you
        next time.</p>

    <p>Anchor: Regardless of what the Doctor said, one thing is really clear. What is happening outside is not natural
        by any scale of assessment. We urge the viewers to strictly stay indoors.</p>

    <p> Shortly after the news telecast ended, the T.V. set started acting weird. Dad unplugged it and asked people to
        assemble in the dining hall for dinner. I felt feverish for a few seconds and thought about what it could be.
        Maybe it is the new bug that is going around. I need to be careful to not pass it to any of the kiddos. Feeling
        sluggish, I went to the first room after the entrance and was reluctant to eat any food. I woke up, assuming
        only a few minutes have passed by. The family gathered around me, cheerful to see me wake up. Grandma says that
        I have been in a “resting-state” for the past 15 days.</p>

    <p> Things are even more bizarre on the outside now. The river in the backyard has extended far too much into the
        inland. Some of the kids seemed to be overly excited about playing next to the river. That is odd, since the
        last time I saw them, they have not been like that. This is quite out of their ordinary behavior. The front of
        the house faces a row of stores across the street. They have all shut down a few days ago.</p>

    <p> The grand uncle says that we are getting constant calls from a local bookseller who likes to buy back Grandpa’s
        old notebook. He bought that several years ago and before he passed away, he was reluctant to leave the sight of
        the book. We all thought he was losing his mind, but since many people are after it, the story seems to be
        deeper than that.</p>

    <p> I hear the shrieks of the children growing louder. Damn it, what is with these kids today. They used to be the
        quiet ones, in the family. Now they have enough volume for all of us. It seemed like the children somehow
        absorbed all the enthusiasm away from the adults. What is happening here?</p>

    <p> As I approach the bank of the river to look at the situation myself, something is odd. The kids’ shrieks did not
        seem joyous. In fact, the closer I get, the more disturbing they sound. There are 4 children playing. The
        youngest one, out of the whim ran towards the middle of the river. The one slightly taller than him ran after
        the first one. Then the third tallest one followed the second one and the tallest of all followed all of them.
        It seemed like an organized band but only walking into the dangerous parts of the flowing river.</p>

    <p> I let out a loud cry in an attempt to stop them. It has absolutely no effect at all. I plunge into the river,
        get hold of the tallest kid put him on my shoulder, then the third tallest kid and then the second tallest child
        then realizing that the youngest is nowhere to be found. He possibly washed away to the other side. There is no
        way to tell. As I walk back to the backyard, we notice that the clouds are drawing thicker and closer to send
        chills across the body. I did not remember it being so cold just a few minutes ago. While shutting the door to
        the backyard, I see one of the dad’s eyes turn into a different texture. They seem more reflective than ever and
        seemed to showcase all that was happening on the outside.</p>

    <p> Back at home, I see that everyone was acting as if they have foreseen the disappearance of the youngest child.
        There was a guy looking at grandpa’s book in the hand and was reading out loud from it. I look over his shoulder
        to get a glance at the content. What I see truly startles me and shakes me to the core.</p>

    <p> Almanac Guy: The book says that the child is not lost. He will be found at a local minister’s house precisely at
        13:43 on November the 5th 1978. But I need to do call a force now.</p>

    <p> Here we are in a state of shock and what is with this moron? And more startlingly, how is the fate of one child
        so precisely mapped in an almanac? What is this guy up to anyways?</p>

    <p> The Almanac Guy walks into the backyard despite our protests. It is even darker now than a moment ago. He walks
        into the alley on the left as he exits the door. As if the whole universe is eager to witness his actions, the
        sounds dampen and there is a sinister silence in the air. Dad and I watch the sight of his white shirt blend
        into the dark void at the end of the alley and eventually disappear. We then see a speckle of faint light moving
        rapidly. In an instant, we see that the one light has split into two and they are growing larger and shaking
        more violently with the second.</p>

    <p> Realizing that this is a creature coming to get us, I grab dad by the arm into the house, shut the door and run
        toward the entrance on the other side of the house. There are more of these lights running free towards every
        door on the street. I lock the front door and make sure that everyone is safe inside the house. We use
        hand-gestures to communicate that all the lights in the rooms facing directly outside be shutdown. We peer into
        the street through gaps in the window blinds. Unbeknownst to the situation, a car drives through the street. All
        the creatures rush towards the car. What I next see is an unmistakable sight of a wolf biting into the
        headlights and its teeth already red.</p>

    <p> We make certain that the doors are secure and turn the TV on. We only see scrolling headlines with a chaotic
        background of the news station. The headlines read “Governor McKenna has introduced a “Shelter-In-Place”
        protocol until further notice”</p>

    <hr>
    <p>Analysis: This dream occurred the night the Shelter in Place protocol was announced in Illinois on 2020-03-20 due
        to the COVID-19 outbreak across the country. The dream is a mixture of rational and irrational arguments seen
        from various angles. But the most important point it hits is that one must stay indoors if trying to be
        safe.</p>

He stops and looks at notice on trestle - 'THE GOLD ROOM.' Jack moves left-right into entrance of Ballroom. He reaches out camera-left and switches on lights - then moves away to lit bar in background. Jack walks left-right across Ballroom - camera tracks and pans with him to bar. Jack leans over counter and looks down. He says to himself: 'God, I'd give anything for a drink?' Sits down and puts hands up to face. 'My goddam soul, just a glass of beer.' He lowers his hands and looks - smiles. 'Hi Lloyd.' Looks camera-right then back at camera. 'A little slow tonight, isn't it?' Laughs. Medium shot Lloyd standing behind bar. Lloyd: 'Yes, it is, Mr. Torrance.' Lloyd moves forward - camera tracks back revealing Jack seated at bar. 'What'll it be?' Jack launches into rambling monologue about money, orders bourbon, glass and ice. Lloyd serves him. Jack makes racial comment 'White man's burden.' Says he's 'temporarily light' on cash. Lloyd says 'Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.' Jack says Lloyd is 'Best goddamned bartender from Timbuctoo to Portland Maine - Portland Oregon for that matter.' Jack toasts 'five miserable months on the wagon and all the irreparable harm that it's caused me.' Drinks. Lloyd asks how things are going. Jack: 'Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.' Describes his problem as 'Just a little problem with the... old sperm bank upstairs.' Lloyd: 'Women! Can't live with 'em. Can't live without 'em!'

Jack: 'As soon as possible. You believe his health might be at stake? And you are concerned about him?' Wendy: 'Yes.' Jack points to himself: 'And are you concerned about me?' Wendy: 'Of course I am.' Jack: 'Have you ever thought about my responsibilities?' Launches into rant about contract, responsibilities to employers, moral principles. Wendy backs to foot of stairs. Jack: 'Has it ever occurred to you what would happen to my future, if I were to fail to live up to my responsibilities?' Wendy swinging bat before her backs up stairs. Jack follows. 'Stay away from me!' 'Why?' 'I just want to go back to my room.' 'Why?' Wendy sobs: 'I'm very confused, and I just need a chance to think things over.' Jack: 'You've had your whole fucking life to think things over - what's good a few minutes more going to do you now?' Wendy: 'Don't hurt me!' Jack: 'I'm not going to hurt you.' Wendy swings bat. Jack: 'Wendy! Darling, light of my life, I'm not going to hurt you. You didn't let me finish my sentence. I said I'm not going to hurt you... I'm just going to bash your brains in!

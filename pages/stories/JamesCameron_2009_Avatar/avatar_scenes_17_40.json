      "plotSummary": {
        "brief": "After completing all trials—pa'li bonding, Iknimaya, first hunt—Jake undergoes the ritual to become full member of the Omaticaya clan. His human past is symbolically burned away. Eytukan paints him with clan markings and welcomes him as one of the People. Even Tsu'tey formally accepts him. The clan celebrates with song, dance, and feast. Jake is no longer alien—he belongs.",
        "detailed": "The clan gathers at Hometree's central fire as evening falls. Jake has completed all the trials required of a young Na'vi hunter. Now he will be formally accepted as Omaticaya. Eytukan, as clan leader, performs the ritual. Jake's old clothing—remnants of his human identity—is burned in the sacred fire. Eytukan speaks the traditional words: 'You are now a son of the Omaticaya. You are part of the People.' He paints ceremonial markings on Jake's face and chest—the warrior patterns of the clan. Mo'at blesses the union with prayers to Eywa. The clan ululates their acceptance, the sound echoing through Hometree. Tsu'tey, though still jealous of Jake's closeness to Neytiri, formally acknowledges him as hunter and clan brother—tradition requires it, and honor demands respect for Jake's accomplishments. The ceremony transforms into celebration. Na'vi drum and sing. They feast on hexapede meat. Young warriors dance, demonstrating hunting prowess. Neytiri dances near Jake, her eyes bright with pride and something deeper—love is growing, though unspoken. Jake is surrounded by clan members welcoming him, teaching him songs, laughing at his still-clumsy Na'vi pronunciation. He has never felt such belonging. In his whole life—not as Marine, not as broken veteran—he has never been part of something like this. He watches the celebration and realizes: this is what he was always searching for. Purpose. Community. Belonging. Home.",
        "subtext": "The acceptance ritual represents Jake's complete transformation on every level: physical (avatar body), skill (hunter), spiritual (understanding Eywa), and social (clan membership). But ironic tension underlies the joy—Jake is still technically a spy for Quaritch, though his loyalties have clearly shifted. He's celebrating acceptance into the clan he's been paid to betray. This internal conflict remains unspoken but grows stronger."

        "brief": "Neytiri leads Jake to the Tree of Voices—a sacred willow grove where Na'vi connect with their ancestors' memories. She reveals she was betrothed to Tsu'tey, but Eywa has chosen differently. Jake and Neytiri make tsaheylu—neural bonding—choosing each other as mates for life. They make love beneath the sacred tree, bonding before Eywa and ancestors. This is commitment, not just passion.",
        "detailed": "After the celebration, Neytiri takes Jake's hand and leads him away from Hometree into the night forest. They walk in charged silence, bioluminescent plants glowing beneath their feet. They arrive at the Tree of Voices—a massive willow-like tree with thousands of bioluminescent tendrils hanging down like a curtain. The tree glows with soft pink and purple light. This is one of Pandora's most sacred sites—a neural hub where Na'vi can connect directly to ancestral memories stored in Eywa's network. Neytiri explains: she was betrothed to Tsu'tey since childhood, as Eytukan's daughter should marry the clan's finest warrior. But something changed. 'The Sky People have sent us a sign,' she says, meaning Jake. The atokirina (woodsprites) chose him. Eywa has chosen differently than tradition demands. She touches Jake's face, seeing him fully. Jake admits he's afraid—of disappointing her, of not being enough, of the complexity of their situation. Neytiri silences him with a touch. She takes his queue and brings it toward her own—the ultimate intimacy. 'I See you,' she says. Not his body, his spirit. Jake responds, 'I See you,' meaning it with his entire being. Their queues intertwine, making tsaheylu—the bond. The sensation overwhelms them both: consciousness merging, boundaries dissolving, feeling each other's emotions and sensations directly. They are one being in two bodies. They make love under the sacred willow, their union witnessed by Eywa and blessed by the ancestors. This is not casual—this is mating for life. Na'vi mate once, permanently. Jake is choosing Neytiri forever, and she him. Afterward, they lie together, queues still bonded, experiencing each other's thoughts and feelings. Jake has never felt so close to another being. He tells her he loves her—the first time he's said it and meant it. She smiles and teaches him the Na'vi words. They sleep bonded under the tree, surrounded by ancient voices and Eywa's presence.",
        "subtext": "This scene is Jake's final commitment to Na'vi life over human existence. Mating with Neytiri isn't just romance—it's choosing one world over another, one identity over another. The location matters: doing this at the Tree of Voices, surrounded by ancestors, makes it a spiritual commitment witnessed by Eywa herself. But tragic irony haunts the beauty: Jake is bonding with Neytiri while still secretly working for Quaritch. This perfect union is built on deception, and that deception will soon destroy everything."

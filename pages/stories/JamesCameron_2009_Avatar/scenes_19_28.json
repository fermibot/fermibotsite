        "detailed": "Jake's consciousness disconnects from his avatar body. His eyes open in the link room—fluorescent lights, recycled air, wheelchair waiting. His human legs lie dead and useless. The contrast is devastating. Where moments ago he was whole, strong, loved, now he's broken again. Jake barely speaks to the technicians. He immediately tries to re-link, desperate to return to Neytiri. Grace intercepts him, seeing the change. She warns him: 'You're losing perspective. Don't forget what's real.' But Jake shoots back: 'Out there is real. This is the dream.' Grace realizes Jake's loyalty has shifted completely. She's seen this before—avatars going native, losing themselves in their other identity. But it's too late; Jake rushes back to the link, back to his true life. In the forest, Neytiri wakes beside his avatar. They're together again. This is where Jake truly lives now.",
        "subtext": "Jake's identity crisis represents colonial narrative inverting—the colonizer 'goes native' and sees indigenous world as real, civilized world as false. His dual existence is untenable; he must choose, and he's already chosen. The wheelchair has become a prison from which his avatar body is escape—except his avatar body is now his real body, and the human form is the false one."

But what do you care?\n           You guys weren't even married six\n           months, were you--? I mean, it was\n           just a coke thing, right?\n\n                          EDDIE\n           Is that what she said--?! \"A coke\n           thing.\"\n\n          It unexpectedly hurts Eddie.

Well... I'm\n           behind. I'm behind on my book, and\n           it's pretty well polluting my days\n           and nights if you really want to\n           know.\n\n                          VERNON\n           How much have you written of it?\n\n          A beat.\n\n                          EDDIE\n           Not one fucking word, Vern.\n\n\n\n\n                          (CONTINUED)\n           11.\n                         CONTINUED:\n\n                          VERNON\n           Wow. Creative problem, huh?\n\n          Vern appraises him.\n\n                          VERNON (CONT'D)\n           I think I have something that can\n           help you.\n\n          He reaches into his pocket. Eddie thinks he knows what's\n          coming.\n\n                          EDDIE\n           Oh, no-- no, no, no-\n\n                          VERNON\n           You don't even know what it is.\n\n                          EDDIE\n           You're still dealing.\n\n                          VERNON\n           No -- yeah --will you listen?! This\n           isn't recreational. I've been doing\n           some consulting for a\n                          PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY--\n\n                          EDDIE\n           You mean a lab in some little\n           Yalie's basement? Give me a--\n\n                          VERNON\n           No, this is an exclusive product\n           coming on-stream next year, they've\n           had clinical trials, and it's FDA\n           approved.\n\n          A long beat. Eddie bites.\n\n                          EDDIE\n           Okay, what is it?\n\n          Vern reaches into his jacket, produces a tiny plastic sachet\n          with his right hand, tapping something out into the palm of\n          his left. He holds this up for Eddie to see... a TINY WHITE\n          UNMARKED TABLET.\n\n                          EDDIE (CONT'D)\n           What's in it?\n\n          Vern puts the little white tablet on the bar.\n\n\n\n\n                          (CONTINUED)\n           12.\n                         CONTINUED: (2)\n\n                          VERN\n           Just take it. Get you over the\n           hump.\n\n                          EDDIE\n           I'm too old for this, Vernon.\n\n                          VERNON\n           Look, they've identified these\n           receptors in the brain that\n           activate specific circuits, and--\n           you know how they say you can only\n           access like 20 percent of your\n           brain? Well, what this does--\n\n                          EDDIE\n           Vernon. Look at me. Do I look good?\n           I smoke too much: my chest is sore.\n           A fucking corpse has more energy\n           than I do, I've got weird aches,\n           possible lumps, rashes, maybe\n           they're a condition, or a network\n           of conditions. One of these days\n           they're all going to hold hands,\n           light up, and I'll keel over dead.\n           My life's in the crapper, and I\n           DON'T think it's going to take a\n           sudden upswing into the\n           stratosphere if I do some brand\n           new, shiny designer DRUG!\n\n          Vern's phone rings. He holds up his index finger --shh! -and\n          takes the call.\n\n                          VERN\n                          (INTO PHONE)\n           Gant.\n           (beat, getting agitated)\n           When. --I know, but when?\n           (looking at his watch)\n           Tell him we can't do that. He knows\n           that's out of the question. We\n           absolutely can't do that.\n\n          Vern is edgy. Very tense. He continues:\n\n                          VERN (CONT'D)\n           No, I'm not going to tell him! You\n           tell him -- no, now!\n\n          He turns off his phone, gets up.\n\n\n\n\n                          (CONTINUED)\n           13.\n                         CONTINUED: (3)\n\n                          VERN (CONT'D)\n           Fucking people. I'm afraid I'm\n           going to have to leave you here,\n           Eddie. But let's hang out again,\n           have another beer.\n\n          He takes out his business card, and places it carefully next\n          to the little white tablet on the bench.\n\n                          VERN (CONT'D)\n           By the way, that's on the house.\n\n                          EDDIE\n           I don't want it, Vern.\n\n          Vern smiles at him.\n\n                          VERN\n           Don't be ungrateful, now. You know\n           how much these things cost?\n\n          Eddie shakes his head.\n\n                          VERN (CONT'D)\n           Eight hundred bucks a pop.\n\n          He pats Eddie on the shoulder and goes. Eddie is still\n          looking at the pill.\n\n          Which seems to be looking back at him."

The cop looks up, taking in\n          the entrance of THREE newly arrested HIGH CLASS HOOKERS.\n\n          They are young. They are blond. They are wearing very short\n          skirts and fuck-me heels. The cop eyes them appreciatively.\n\n           EDDIE (V.O.)\n           But I knew, when his attention\n           wandered to something more\n           pressing, that he was going to let\n           me go."

Then stops. He\n          turns pale. Is sweating.\n\n                          LINDY (CONT'D)\n           What. What.\n\n          Eddie takes a step. And suddenly... He's across the room.\n          Boom. A skip in time.\n\n           EDDIE (V.0.)\n           Then... I found myself at the door.\n           With no consciousness that I had\n           moved.\n\n          He puts his hand on a table, steadies himself. He catches a\n          look, in the mirror, of this lean, handsome, dapper shark he\n          has become.\n\n                          LINDY\n           Are you all right?\n\n          He doesn't look all right.\n\n                          LINDA\n           When was the last time you ate\n           something?\n\n          Dully the realization penetrates Eddie's fog:\n\n           EDDIE (V.O.)\n           It had been three days."

We tilt up to CARL VAN\n          LOON, a young 50, no less vital and intense than the\n          hungriest 27-year-old shark on the make. But he affects\n          geniality. He sits; the middle-aged man with him, PIERCE,\n          does the same.\n\n                          VAN LOON\n           So. Eddie Morgan.\n\n          He looks Eddie directly in the eyes.\n\n           VAN LOON (CONT'D)\n           What's your secret?\n\n          A beat.

Pierce doesn't.\n           50.\n\n\n          ANOTHER ANGLE - LATER - THAT NIGHT\n\n          Eddie is in mid-spiel, Van Loon listening intently.\n\n                          EDDIE\n           --Yes, that's partially what I'm\n                          SAYING--\n\n                          PIERCE\n                          (CONTEMPTUOUSLY)\n           Pattern recognition? So that's your\n           snake-oil? Look, if there's one\n           thing we all understand, it's\n           understanding itself --that's how\n           the business works...\n                          (SCOFFING)\n           Pattern recognition.

Pierce is annoyed. Van Loon is\n          mildly amused, but not necessarily impressed.

You see a\n           chance, you blink, and it's gone.\n           We entered the age of\n           decentralized, online decision-\n           making, with the decisions being\n           made by hundreds of millions of\n           individual investors around the\n           world, people who don't even know\n           each other -- making a killing in\n           less time than it takes to sneeze.\n\n                          PIERCE\n           Until they weren't.\n\n                          EDDIE\n           Same rules, even in a panic. It's\n           not understanding how companies\n           work. It's understanding how mass\n           psychology works.\n\n                          PIERCE\n                          (SCOFFING)\n           And you have a formula.\n\n\n\n                          (CONTINUED)\n           51.\n                         CONTINUED:\n\n                          KEVIN\n                          (MEDIATING)\n           Well, from 12 thousand to two point\n           eight million in ten days--\n\n                          EDDIE\n           Yes. I do have a formula, Mr.\n           Pierce.\n\n                          PIERCE\n                          (SNORTING)\n           Delusions of grandeur.\n\n                          EDDIE\n           I don't have delusions of grandeur.\n\n          A beat, as we PUSH IN on Eddie's face.\n\n                          EDDIE (CONT'D)\n           I have an actual recipe for\n           grandeur.\n\n          Kevin stares in horror.

I got\n           lazy... and slow... put on\n           weight... the magazine let me go.\n           My husband checked out. Sex? Get\n           out of here.\n\n          She leans back, looks him in the eyes.\n\n                          MELISSA (CONT'D)\n           That was two years ago, and I\n           haven't been the same since. I\n           can't read any more -- I mean, the\n           fucking New York Post?\n\n          Eddie feels ill, physically ill, hearing this.\n\n                          MELISSA (CONT'D)\n           After this, I'm going to have a\n           migraine for three days. And I've\n           got to pee. Which is another thing.\n\n          She gets up... goes to the Ladies room. And now Eddie sees --\n          she wears a LEG BRACE. Like a kid, from the old days, with\n          Polio.\n\n           EDDIE (V.0.)\n           How many times had I thought of\n           her, my first real love...\n\n          We see FLASHES OF YOUNG MELISSA...\n\n           EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D)\n           But that Melissa had unraveled in\n           time and space -- she was a ghost\n           now. I was never going to see her\n           again, never bump into her in the\n           street...\n\n          The tears gather behind Eddie's eyes. He can't help it. He\n          puts his hand to his face to hide his emotions.\n           70."

Under the deafening\n                         DRILL:\n\n          MORE JUMP-CUTS as Eddie hysterically tears the packing paper\n          off of promisingly- shaped objects. --No. A glass. --No. A\n          vase. --YES! The sugar bowl. With sugar still inside! Eddie\n          rummages, frantically, among the sugar cubes as the door\n          gives a few inches, groaning, and we glimpse blurred faces on\n          the other side...\n\n                         EDDIE'S HAND\n\n          pokes, wildly, among the cubes... pushing them aside,\n          revealing at the bottom of the bowl-\n\n          ONE MDT TABLET looks back up at him.\n\n          Yes. It's really there! Eddie grabs it, just as, with a\n          splintering CRASH! -- The door goes down.\n\n          Eddie steps back, brings the pill up to his mouth... But as\n          he steps, he TRIPS on a SOUP CAN he's scattered... he FALLS\n          backwards... his HAND hits the side of the coffee table...\n\n\n\n\n                          (CONTINUED)\n           105.\n                         CONTINUED:\n\n          The MDT TABLET goes flying... (slow motion)... as... ...also\n          in slow motion, Gennady and his two thugs smile as they\n          advance into the room... THE MDT TABLET... flies... flies...\n          towards a GRATE in the floor -- a heating vent -- and HITS\n          it... rolling... ... before disappearing forever down the\n          grate.\n\n          Eddie knows that's it. His life has ended. He sucks in his\n          last breath -- then, with a YELL, he rushes back for the\n          terrace... for his suicide leap...\n\n          Thug #1 is quicker. Gets to the door first. Eddie will not\n          have the luck to be able to jump. He's trapped between the\n          two Thugs.\n\n                          GENNADY\n           I told you I want more. You don't\n           listen. Maybe you think I'm\n           joking...\n\n          He reaches into his coat pocket...\n\n                          GENNADY (CONT'D)\n           But I'm down to this last one.\n\n          ...and pulls out a syringe.\n\n                          GENNADY (CONT'D)\n           See, I dissolve pill in solution.\n           You shoot it - goes straight into\n           blood and to brain. Works much\n           better.\n\n          He pulls the plastic sleeve off the needle. Jabs himself in\n          the arm and injects the cloudy liquid.\n\n                          GENNADY (CONT'D)\n           Now. Where do you keep yours?\n\n          Eddie is backed to the wall. Nowhere to go.\n\n                          EDDIE\n           I'm plum out.\n\n          Gennady just smiles -- that was an unfortunate choice. He\n          gives an order to the Thugs who grab their tools and\n          disappear deeper into the apartment. WE HEAR them starting to\n          tear things up. Gennady and Eddie are alone.\n\n                          GENNADY\n           They will find it. Or I will make\n           you tell me. Which is quicker? We\n           see, huh?\n\n\n                          (CONTINUED)\n           106.\n                         CONTINUED: (2)\n\n          He clicks open a BLACK ATTACHE CASE. It is filled with\n          sinister-looking silver instruments, and knives."

Eddie turns the fillet\n          knife back on Gennady, slashes at his other arm; blood\n          spurts. But it's not necessary. Gennady's eyes are glazing.\n          His gurgling gets quieter.

Looking at the blood.\n          It creeps closer to Eddie's face. Eddie is trying to move,\n          trying to push his face closer to the blood... he's there...\n\n          And now he turns his face down into the blood.\n\n          And begins to lap it up."

Van Loon needs to fill a position. Eddie is hired. Montage: Two months pass. Eddie helps broker 'the most important merger in corporate history.' In conference room with Van Loon, Pierce, and power players, Eddie sketches elaborate charts - even Pierce looks impressed. At W Hotel eating room service, Eddie takes pills carefully: 'if I maintained an even dose... remembered to eat... drank no alcohol... the blackouts didn't recur.' Back at Lafayette Day Trading. At Madison Avenue tailor getting suits made, Eddie asks for 'imperceptible compartment' to hide pills."

John Steadman from Eiben-Chemcorps reveals he invented MDT and offers Eddie unlimited supply in exchange for political favors. Eddie claims he's weaned himself off and has created defensive structures that make him untouchable. He walks away, but appears scared",
        "detailed": "Title card: 'Eight months later.' Eddie Morgan is running for Senate with massive momentum - overflow fundraisers, wave of donations, opponent won't debate. John Steadman from pharmaceutical company Eiben-Chemcorps arrives. He reveals his company invented MDT, it escaped through a 'security breach' (Vernon), they shut down Eddie's replication labs. He offers Eddie a 'limitless supply' with fewer side effects in exchange for political compliance - 'grandiose but achievable' goals involving foreign policy, courts, even the Constitution. Eddie refuses, claiming he's weaned himself off the drug and created 'defense structures that would scare the Israelis.' He bluffs about people with guns on Steadman right now, claims he might even figure out how to get off MDT completely. Steadman leaves ominously. Eddie exhales, and we see he's actually scared - but we don't know if he's bluffing or genuinely free.",
        "subtext": "The ending is deliberately ambiguous. Is Eddie still on MDT and bluffing? Has he truly weaned himself off and retained the benefits? Did his enhanced mind solve the unsolvable problem of dependency? His fear suggests vulnerability; his confidence suggests truth. The real question: can you ever truly be free of enhancement once you've tasted it?"

A perfect ending for a cautionary tale that also seduces us with the fantasy of unlimited potential."

## Technical Notes

### MDT Pill Count Tracking
- Starts with ~200 pills from Vernon's stash
- Consumption increases from 1/day to 2-3/day
- Major losses: Gennady takes pills, gives 10 away
- Critical shortage triggers crisis around scene 27
- Desperation leads to lab synthesis attempts
- Final resolution involves either freedom from drug or stable supply

### Cognitive State Progression
1. Baseline → Enhanced (scenes 1-20)
2. Enhanced with withdrawals (scenes 21-35)
3. Crisis/desperation (scenes 36-45)
4. Resolution (scenes 46-50)

### Tension Arc
- Scenes 1-10: Building (2-7)
- Scenes 11-20: Rising (5-10)
- Scenes 21-30: Peak tension (7-10)
- Scenes 31-40: Sustained high (8-10)
- Scenes 41-50: Climax and resolution (9-10, then 5)

## Next Steps

To complete the file, scenes 21-50 need to be added with the same level of detail as scenes 1-20, including:
- All location details
- Time tracking (narrative, runtime, approximate)
- Cognitive state and MDT tracking
- Complete plot summaries (brief, detailed, subtext)
- Character development for all relevant characters
- Key dialogue with context
- Visual storytelling details
- Thematic elements
- Sci-fi analysis
- Symbols
- Tension levels
- Significance statements
- Foreshadowing and callback arrays

The file structure is ready and validated. The remaining scenes follow the screenplay closely through the merger work, withdrawal crisis, Lindy's escape, Gennady confrontations, the penthouse siege, drinking Gennady's blood, and the final confrontation with Steadman one year later.

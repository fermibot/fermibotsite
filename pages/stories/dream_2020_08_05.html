    <h4>Author's Note</h4>
    <pre>July 31, 1984</pre>
    <p>This happened at the university a few years back. The incident leaves me stunned whenever I think about it. There
        are many things I still do not understand about that day. There is also a sense of timelessness to it which is
        why I chose to write the story in the present tense. If you had followed the news from the year 1980, you
        probably heard about the power purge that took place in the western block of the city. The officials ruled it
        out as a seasonal incident. I, however, think there is more to it. And my set of ‘facts’ might be completely
        different from what the news was screaming about. Regardless of what people might think, it is my responsibility
        to tell my part of the story. I will let you be the judge.</p>

    <h4>The Incident</h4>
    <pre>June 22, 1980</pre>
    <p>The monsoon is at its peak in Hyderabad. Today’s lecture is in the science building which is located in the
        northeast
        corner of the campus. The rain has delayed the shuttle service and I had to walk from our dorm which was about a
        kilometer south of where I am headed.
    </p>

    <p>Our astrophysics class takes place in the darker corner of the department. As I enter the hallways, I could smell
        the dank air. There is a sense of eeriness attached to these old walls and today’s situation does not make the
        sights of the classroom any better. The walls of the hallways are plastered with missing posters of several
        civilian scientists and other researchers. This is really odd because I did not see them last week. One
        particular headline was disturbing and it read “3 professors and 24 students on a field trip to the Atacama
        desert have disappeared after an electromagnetic surge in the nearby valley”</p>

    <p>A security guard was running towards the department head’s office. Although they seemed to be arguing very
        loudly, their voices were muffled from where I was standing. After a few minutes, I saw them both exiting the
        office with grim expressions on their faces.</p>

    <p>I see my friend Goutham entering the classroom and he doesn’t notice me. He was his usual self, lost in his
        thoughts. Since the power is gone, it is ever dimmer in the classrooms. The professor has brought with himself
        an old lantern to brighten the wall and the blackboard. The lantern does not help that much. Because we were a
        curious bunch, there was a decent turn up for the class (quite unexpectedly so).</p>

    <p> I notice that a large proportion of the people in the class have their heads hung down. It looked as if they
        were here on a compulsion. My initial assumption about the students being eager for the class is wrong. The
        professor’s writings on the board were barely visible and I was struggling as always to make sense out of them.
        Goutham, on the other hand, was deeply indulged in copying the equations to his notes.</p>

    <p> Meghana was a little late to the class and she sat next to me. She was wearing a traditional teal blue lehenga.
        Her face is was the only thing worth looking at in this classroom. She leaned towards me to take a look at my
        notes. I could smell a hint of her rose perfume. Her loose hair rubbed against my arms and it was a good
        feeling. She seemed excited about something and whispered in my ear that it was her birthday.</p>

    <p> After the professor read his text, he grew more anxious by the second. He threw his notes into the trash can and
        opened a thin book titled astrophysics for veterans. The title itself is scary enough to ward off students. I
        wondered what he had in his mind today. While turning the pages, he instructed us to go to page 3422. This is
        impossible since the book was only half an inch thick and it was published as a single volume.</p>

    <p> The sight of all of this made Meghana concerned and she was holding my arm in apprehension. I can hear her
        breathing grow faster. The professor was scribbling things faster and illegibly. To our surprise, he started
        dragging the board to the left side after filling it all up with his chalk. As if the board was being brought
        from another dimension, the other end of the board seemed to have not edge. It was endless!</p>

    <p> Goutham was copying the notes verbatim from the board and his notebook was also growing in the number of pages.
        Two things happened which shook us by surprise. Firstly, the professor was trying to correct an equation writing
        at the beginning of the lecture. He dragged the board in the opposite direction from left to right and the board
        was breaking apart into pieces when moving in this direction. And secondly, Gowtham was searching for the same
        equation in his book and the fast flipping of the pages seemed to have craked the integrity of time-space at
        that instant. A portal opened in his notebook and he spelunked into the book trying to locate the equations. He
        disappeared.</p>

    <p> The situation became more chaotic as the professor was frantically erasing some sections of the equations he
        wrote. I pulled Meghana by the arm and we both ran outside. She held me tight and closed her eyes. I was shaking
        with fear too. After a few seconds and a lot of rumble later, the chaos has settled the classroom was back to
        its normal. It was as if nothing has happened. Gowtham was back again sitting on his desk. He had a smile that
        someone has when they figured out the meaning of life. The professor very calmly exited the classroom
        recommending the reading material for the next session. Just before he left he said, “do not make the mistake
        while reading page 3422”.</p>

    <p> What happened to the Atacama expedition group is possibly similar. We might not know that right away.</p>

    <p> As of now, I have a wonderful event to attend. Meghana has invited me to her birthday celebrations with her
        parents. There would be only 4 of us. I am glad this day is going to end on a beautiful note.</p>

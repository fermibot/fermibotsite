A few ramshackle outbuildings cling to the \nsurface like barnacles. On the highest point of the island \nstands a tall, crumbling LIGHTHOUSE TOWER.

Tall, athletic –- but starved. \nHis deep set eyes are haunted, and his left eye is healing \nfrom a week-old shiner. His crooked expression is severe. \nThere’s an eerie disquiet about him. He’s like a dog that’s \nbeen beaten and caged too many times. A small mustache shows \nhis vanity. \nThe other is OLD (Haggard 60? Spry 70?). He’s weathered, \nferal bearded, and hunched, with hands like vises. His lack \nof visible lips suggests some missing teeth. He tremors a \nbit, but he’s lean and sturdy as a lead pipe. His high \ncheekbones smile even when he grimaces. His wild eyes shine \nlike jewels. He’s an old Pan. A Satyr.\nBoth of them seem like the kind of man you might find \nmuttering to himself in the corner of an empty bar room with \na distant look in his eye. \nThey watch THE TENDER depart the island, ever-so-slowly \ndisappearing -- swallowed up again by the fog.2.\n\nTHE FOGHORN bellows louder than ever, penetrating deep \nthrough the bodies of the two men. IT SHAKES THE YOUNG MAN – \nshocks him  – but not the OLD one. He’s used to it. \nOLD puts the stump of an unlit clay PIPE in his mouth (upside \ndown). He lumbers out of frame, limping a bit, and happy to \nfinally be “home again.”             \nYOUNG stays standing, staring out. A bit of fear strikes him.   \nThere’s no turning back now."

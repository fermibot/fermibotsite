Aye.\nOLD sees the sea life clearly in his eyes. The stories he \nmust have.\nOLD (CONT\u2019D)\nAin\u2019t nothing what can touch it.  \nHe snaps himself out of it:\nOLD (CONT\u2019D)\nBut can\u2019t be draggin\u2019 me old stump \nabout...\n(Referring to his limp) \nNay... not worth the trouble... now \nI\u2019m a wickie and a wickie I is. I\u2019m \ndamn-well wedded to this here \nlight, and she\u2019s been a finer, \ntruer, quieter wife than any a live-\nblooded woman.\nYOUNG\nEver married?\nOLD\nThirteen Christmases at sea... \nlittle \u2018uns at home. She never \nforgave it.\nPause. \n(MORE)31.\n\n\u2018Tis fer the better. \nPause. \nIt\u2019s clear that OLD has regrets. But rather than dwell on a \npainful past, he changes the subject.\nOLD (CONT\u2019D)\nSince we\u2019re getting too friendly, \nEphraim Winslow, tell me, what\u2019s a \ntimber man want with being a \nwickie? Not enough quiet for ye up \nnorth? Sawdust itching yer  nethers? \nForeman found ye too high-tempered \nfor carrying an axe?\nThat last comment rubs YOUNG the wrong way, but he tries not \nto give in to the feeling.\nYOUNG\nLike you says, just had enough of \ntrees, I guess. \nOLD looks him over suspiciously as he lights his pipe.\nYOUNG focuses on his cigarette. Lights. Draws. \nYOUNG (CONT\u2019D)\nSince I left Dad, well... I done \nevery kind of work can pay a man. \nSome I ain\u2019t near proud of. \nOLD\nDrifter, eh ?\nYOUNG\nNo sir! Just can\u2019t find a post I \ncan take a real shine to, so I keep \nmovin\u2019 along. And I ain\u2019t the kind \nto look back at what\u2019s behind him, \nsee.\nOLD\nOn the run?\nYOUNG gets defensive. Did he say too much?\nYOUNG\nNo sir -- now look here, now -- I \nmean, nothin\u2019 wrong with a man \nstartin\u2019 fresh, startin\u2019 new, \nlookin\u2019 to earn a living\u2013\u2013OLD (CONT'D)32.\n\nOLD\nNo...\nYOUNG\n...like any man, tryin\u2019 to settle \ndown quiet-like with some \nearnings... \nI read a man could earn six hundred \nand thirty \u2013\u2013 I read one thousand  \ndollars a year if he\u2019s willing to \ntend a light far off shore... the \nfurther away, the more he earns. I \nread that, and hell, I says, \nyessir. Work. Save my earnings. \nSoon enough, I\u2019ll raise my own \nroof, somewheres up country, with \nno one to tell me \u201cwhat for\u201d... \nThat\u2019s all.\nYOUNG smiles. He thinks he is doing a pretty good job \ncovering up his fear that OLD may sense more than he lets on. \nThe cigarette helps.\nOLD\nSame ol\u2019  borin\u2019 story, eh? \nYOUNG\nYou asked.",

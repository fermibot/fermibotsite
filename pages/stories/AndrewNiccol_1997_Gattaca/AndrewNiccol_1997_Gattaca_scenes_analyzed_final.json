He carries himself wi t\u00b7h a' certalon' I \narrogance, a cool detachment. All employees wear similarly . \nunconventionally-cut suits, short coiffed hair and robust tans. \nThe Gattaca employees are a seemingly equal split of men and \nwomen and a diverse range of ethnicities. \nThey filter through a row of channels supervised by SECURITY \nGUARDS. Each channel contalons a computerized security device, \nfeaturing a slim groove in which the employee places a finger \nunder the watchful eye of a Security Guard. \nJerome \nfinger \n'. finest gives a polite \nin the groove. \nof needles and nod to a Guard \nHis fingertip \na minute blood as he places his index \nis jabbed with the \nsample taken. \nThe blood specimen confirms Jerome's identity -an ID photograph \nappearing on a computer screen. \nOut of the corner of his eye, Jerome spies a young woman \nentering through the adjacent channel. She is also sneaking a \nglance in his direction -IRENE. Catching each other looking, \nthey both quickly avert thelor eyes. \nAs Jerome enters the computer facility of Gattaca Aerospace \nCorporatloon he furtively glances at the pin-prick puncture in \nhis fingertip sachet. \nSCME'IIHERE IN CEEP SP.;CE. \nA GATTACA spacecraft sk~=~s an asteroid. \nthe rock's grav~tational pull, the craft \nthe black void.

Each curved desk conta~ns a \ncomputer terminal consisting of a keyboard and a slim, \ntransparent screen behind wh~ch is seated a PROGRAMMER, \ndeSigning software for the aerospace agency. At the center of \nthe room is a donut-shaped command console, chairs facing \noutwards, from which operations are monitored. \nFloor to ceiling smoked-glass curved walls offer the only \n'.concession to nature - a tlnted view of a man-made, met~culously \n\"landscaped garden. \nJerome tears himself away from his screen and picks up a \ndiscreet mini-vac. He vacuums between the keys of his keyboard. \nDIRECTOR JOSEF, 50's, a shorter, official-looking man \napproaches. His assistant IRENE stands at his shoulder, \nDIREC'roR JOSEF \nYou keep your work station so clean, Jerome. \nJEROME \n--Next to Godliness, isn't that what they say? \nThe Director smlles at the notion and places a computer dlSC \non Jerome's desk.

At a nearby work station, a painfully thin programmer, NAPOLEON, perks up at \nthe mention of the test. \nJerome merely shrugs and pretends to reach down and scratch his \nankle. However he surreptitiously produces one of Eugene's \ntransparent specimen bags from his sock. An EXTREME CLOSE UP \nreveals the bag'S contents -flakes of skin, hair follicles, \neyelashes, a fingernail. Cupping the bag in his hand to avoid \ndetection, Jerome sprinkles the fraudulent body matter over his \nkeyboard, desk surfaces and the floor around his work station. \nHe opens his desk drawer and casually sc'att'ers the remainder of \nthe bag. Finally he inspects a comb already laced with two \nhair follicles. \nJerome rises from his work station and makes his way towards the \ntestlng lab. ",

LUNCHTIME.\nIn Gattaca's perfectly landscaped gardens JEROME, dressed and \nrecovered from his ordeal, joins his COLLEAGUES for lunch at one \nof the umbrella-covered tables. While most of the others pick \nat unappetizing salads and take their individualized medication, \nJerome carries a steak sandwich on his tray. \nThe sight of the juicy steak is greeted with enVlOUS looks frbm \nhis colleagues. Jerome pretends not to notice and rubs it in by \nliberally sprinkling salt onto the meat. \nHowever when Jerome looks over towards IRENE, she avoids eye \ncontact. When she abruptly gets up and leaves, Jerome follows -\nthinking twice before depositing the napkin in the nearby \ntrashcan. A janitor reaches for the napkin. It is the Old \nJanitor, CAESAR, from Jerome's former life. \nCAESAR I'll take care of that for you, Mr Morrow . \n\u2022 The two men exchange a conspiratorial smile. ",

The p~~nist tosses one \nof his white gloves into the front row where it LS caught by an \nadoring FAN. The second glove he tosses up to the box where \nJEROME and IRENE are standing. Jerome snares the glove out of \nthe air and immediately hands it to Irene. She promptly slips \nthe glove on her own hand. \nThe glove fits snugly over her five fingers. However one finger \nof the glove remains unfilled. Jerome is stunned to realize that it is a six-fingered glove. \nIRENE \n(catching his look of astonishment) \nYou didn't know? \nJEROME \n(trying too hard to convince) \nYes ... yes ... \nIRENE \n(picking up a resentment, confused') \nYou're angry--\nJEROME \nWhy would I be angry? It was beautiful. \nHe quickly turns away to lead the applause. On stage, the \npianist raises his hands to acknowledge the crowd. Both his \nhands contain a perfectly formed extra finger. ",

      "text": "INT. EUGENE'S CONDOMINIUM. EARLY MORNING.\nJEROME emerges from the incinerator room into a large, luxurious loft-style condo containing a bizarre assortment of equipment -\narranged somewhat like a product~on line. \nLong, scrupulously clean metal work benches are arranged along \none entire wall. Laid out on the benches in neat rows are I . \ndozens of plastic bags -some filled, some unfilled. Instrument, \non trays -various types of t'weezers, scissors and other less \nfamiliar utensils. Round, stainless steel containers filled \nwith hairs of differing lengths and other body matter. \nJEROME approaches another man slumped over one of the benches. \nEUGENE. He clutches an empty vodka bottle. He is snoring \nlightly -sleeping off I:he night before. As JEROME gently \nprises the bottle out of hlS hand, we are struck by the \nslmilarity of Eugene's face to Jerome's. \nJerome pulls Eugene's chair back from the desk with surprising \nease. A wheelchair - a modern, ergonomic design. Jerome wheels \n. ,Eugene to a bedroom and, with some difficulty, hauls the larger \n. 'man onto the bed, Through his alcoholic fog, Eugene feebly co\u00ad\noperates -his paralyzed legs a particular dead weight. \nAfter covering Eugene with a blanket, Jerome enters a bathroom \ncontaining a surgically-clean stainless steel basin, sink, \nshower and toilet. \nBeside the toilet stands a large, industrial-style stalnless \nsteel refrigerator. \nDonning protective gloves, Jerome opens the liquid-nitrogen \ncooled refrigerator. A cloud of condensed water vapor bil.lows \nout. Revealed inside the fridge are racks of labelled jars and \nsilicon pouches -some containing a yellowish liquid, some a \ndeep, red liquid. (CONTINUED) \nCONTlNUEO \nIn fr~nt of one of the jars is a handwritten shopping list -\n\"TRUFFLES, CIGS, VOCKA\". Jerome smiles to himself as he \nretr:eves the note along with one of the Jars. He checks the Jar's label. Satisfied with the date written there, he breaks \nthe seal and pours the contents into the clear, silicon pouch of \nan IV-like device lying on the steel bathroom counter. \nHe seals the pouch and checks the apparatus by open~ng the val'/e \non its fine tube and squirting a small quantity of the liqu~d \ninto the nearby toilet bowl, as one would test a syringe. We \nremain on Jerome's face as he reaches between his legs and \ninserts the pouch. \nReopening the refrigerator, Jerome slides out a tray contai'ning \nneat rows of slim, fingertip-sized plastic sachets filled with a \ndeep, red-colored liquid. He removes his gloves, selects one of \nthe sachets and carefully adheres the sachet to the pad at the \nend of his index finger. He prepares a second sachet for nis \nmiddle finger. Jerome then applies skin-colored cover-up makeup \nto the sachets, blending them in with the color of his fingers .. J \nJEROME, still dressed in hl.S robe, climbs a large,. spiral \nstaircase to the floor above. "

Each curved desk conta~ns a \ncomputer terminal consisting of a keyboard and a slim, \ntransparent screen behind wh~ch is seated a PROGRAMMER, \ndeSigning software for the aerospace agency. At the center of \nthe room is a donut-shaped command console, chairs facing \noutwards, from which operations are monitored. \nFloor to ceiling smoked-glass curved walls offer the only \n'.concession to nature - a tlnted view of a man-made, met~culously \n\"landscaped garden. \nJerome tears himself away from his screen and picks up a \ndiscreet mini-vac. He vacuums between the keys of his keyboard. \nDIRECTOR JOSEF, 50's, a shorter, official-looking man \napproaches. His assistant IRENE stands at his shoulder, \nDIREC'roR JOSEF \nYou keep your work station so clean, Jerome. \nJEROME \n--Next to Godliness, isn't that what they say? \nThe Director smlles at the notion and places a computer dlSC \non Jerome's desk.

At a nearby work station, a painfully thin programmer, NAPOLEON, perks up at \nthe mention of the test. \nJerome merely shrugs and pretends to reach down and scratch his \nankle. However he surreptitiously produces one of Eugene's \ntransparent specimen bags from his sock. An EXTREME CLOSE UP \nreveals the bag'S contents -flakes of skin, hair follicles, \neyelashes, a fingernail. Cupping the bag in his hand to avoid \ndetection, Jerome sprinkles the fraudulent body matter over his \nkeyboard, desk surfaces and the floor around his work station. \nHe opens his desk drawer and casually sc'att'ers the remainder of \nthe bag. Finally he inspects a comb already laced with two \nhair follicles. \nJerome rises from his work station and makes his way towards the \ntestlng lab. "

DAY .\nTwenty GATTACA EMPLOYEES, identically-outfitted men and women, \nrun in a perfectly straight line towards the tranquil lake oE \nthe picturesque grounds, never getting any closer to their goal. \nThey run at a steady lOmph on twenty identical state-of-the-ar: \ntreadmill machines sunken into the floor and arranged in a \nuniform row facing a floor to ceiling window. The strain is \nbeginning to shaw on many of the faces. The heartrate of each \nemployee is monitored via a wireless electrode attached to the \nchest. \nOutside 1n the sunshine the next batch of twenty EMPLOYEES \nlimbers up in readiness for their physical. JEROME's only \npreparation consists of dragging thoughtfully on a \ncigarette while staring out at the man-made lake. His \nnonchalant attitude disheartens nearby collleagues, including \nIRENE who is amongst 'a group of workers \"exc,used from the run \nby benevolent, over-protective TRAINERS. \nTRAINER \nYou're excused, Irene. You may resume your duties. \nOn the way into the work-out facility Jerome'stubs out his \ncigarette in a stainless steel ashtray. Only we are aware of \nthe slim credit card-sized recording device that he furtively slips out of his cigarette pack and secrets in his hand. As he \ntakes his place on one of the treadmills and adheres the \ncordless electrode to his chest, Jerome surreptitiously attaches '. h1S device to the underside of the running machine's control .. panel.

        <p style="text-indent: 5%">Its a day in a future that may not be very far. I walk through the crowded market
            where the numerous sellers
            are eager to sell their goods off. There is a sense of urgency as if someone is overlooking their doings. I
            whizz past a combination of fragrances, a medley of spices, perfumes, and used clothes. Thick fumes envelop
            the town completely clouding the sun and almost diminishing its directionality and brightness.</p>

        <p>I suppose this was only expected. The forefathers aimed for a world where people could eat well sleep well,
            or at least their intentions were. But as I look at the world today, it seems like an attempt (if any) to
            save our home was half-hearted at best. I tried blaming the past for what has happened but that hasn’t given
            me any recluse. So I tried hoping for a slightly bearable future. I am aware that my perspective is less
            likely to cause any monumental change. The world even with its chaos has a lot of inertia and always acts in
            the direction of its resources. The most precious resources of today are water and air that do not kill you
            in an instant.</p>

        <p> People know me as Fermi, at least that is the earliest name I can remember. In a different world, I used to
            be a Typesetter working out of my parents’ garage. There is no need for printing anymore in this world.
            There is no free media. All the information can be requested from data centers that are located next to the
            administrative offices. All the information is strictly controlled to give out the most necessary
            information only. I recall requesting data about administrative offices. All I was given was the address to
            the very same administrative office and some instructions on how to request information.</p>

        <p> Getting any printing related job is only possible at the admin office and they have plenty of skilled and
            obedient people already. I now work as a vegetable vendor. My work week starts on Monday morning and
            continues until Sunday mid-morning. Towards the end of the long work week, I head out into the areas
            surrounding the cities. In this world of ours, there are habitable zones that have most of the basic
            facilities. The rest of the world is not easily accessible via any public means of transport and there isn’t
            much hope for private means as well. The official explanation for these “Other Zones” is that we have been
            quarantined from an inexplicable reality that is beyond the walls of the city.</p>

        <p>I am 35 now and do not have any friends or family left anymore. I took three days off from my work which took
            me three years of work to earn. I used some of the saved money to take a semi-guided tour of the Other
            Zones. The tour starts from the intercity tram station that people refer to as the tramp station. With so
            many people going missing from the tram services, it seems like only the people with little or no will to
            live would want to use them.</p>

        <p> A given tram car is enormous and its primary purpose is to share the resources and information between the
            cities. When the people are at the maximum capacity the weight of all the people including the driver and
            the crew makes up only about 2 percent of the total cargo. This is excluding the weight of the tram
            itself.</p>

        <p>I got into the first available car of the day and I really do not have any hope of returning to my work. The
            conductor, an old man aged about 60 takes my ticket and does not give me my half back. I assume the ticket
            would be possibly recycled for another 100 trips. The visible scenery was duller and drabber than I
            expected. I only see these endless series of cuboid facilities and there are not many live trees in sight. I
            wake up and see that the car is not moving anymore. There is thick fog surrounding me and co-passengers do
            not seem to have a care in the world about what is happening. I do not recall a stop being listed in the
            itinerary.</p>

        <p> I notice that the conductor is yelling at someone through his cabin and at best I could only hear a muddled
            discussion between him and someone down below. The other voice is very deep and very loud. I do not think
            that is humanly possible to talk like that. While the conductor and the crew are engaged in the discussion,
            I sneak out of the passenger car and peak out of the unused service window on the floor. I look at the
            surface I see that that they are trying to load hoist cargo upwards and into the bottom part of the car.
            There is a heavy metallic odor in the air, nothing like any other metal I have known before.</p>

        <p> As I was walking back to my seat, the car jerks, possibly from the release of the tension cables from the
            tram to the crew on the ground. Before I try restoring my balance a second jerk throws me through the
            service window. The next few seconds have been hazy at best. I was in a state between a strange euphoria and
            shock. The euphoria was probably induced by having never before experienced a free fall. I land with a thud
            followed by a feeling of being engulfed.</p>

        <p> I find myself on the edge of a lake that is more mud than water. After several minutes of rubbing my eyes
            and temples, I finally get my faculties into a usable state. I examine my surroundings and find only a
            single source of light about a hundred yards away. I use the top thin clear layer of the muddy sedimented
            lake to wash off the dirt from my clothes and I head towards the light source. As I get closer, I see that
            there a loud pounding noise, followed by several seconds of quiet. As I get closer to the light source, it
            becomes more apparent that it is a leaked light from the window of some facility. The pounding becomes
            louder, God this is unbearable.</p>

        <p> Having observed no sign of life, I walk into the open doors on the front of the building and take the stairs
            right next to the entrance. There is a control room with lots of levers and pullies. The pounding is even
            louder now. There is no one in the control room and it almost seems like the place is running itself. The
            room has an open window with no glass, and it overlooks the barren canyon. Finding nothing more interesting,
            I try heading out into the dark of the night to possibly where I landed. The sidewall, however, is heavily
            riveted and seems to be separating the control room from whatever is happening on the other side. The wall
            is very sturdy and does not seem to be reflective in any way. There are strategically placed openings in the
            wall possibly to exchange information.</p>

        <p> As I walk back, I get caught in surprise by what looks like an eye staring at me from a hole in the wall.
            Whatever it was, it saw me and it wants to get me. I hear the riveted walls being hammered from the other
            side. Panic hits me as I imagine a giant trying to break to the wall to get me. I jump through the open
            window of the control room and barely holding on to the edge while carefully landing on the floor outside
            the building. I run away from the facility towards the thick forest of dead trees and shrubs. I take a
            glimpse of the rising sun after many days. As the morning begins to brighten up, I see that everything in
            the forest, including me, is coated in a layer of a shiny powder. Every time the earth pounds the ground
            shakes the powder off a little. The powder then stays suspended in the air for a few seconds before settling
            again. This effect has been almost completely invisible before the sunrise.</p>


        <p>I continue running through the gaunt foliage and cut myself at several places on the leg. I keep running
            towards the lake to possibly wait for the tram to stop. After several hours of waiting, I hear the faint
            squeak of the car from the cables above. It is time to go home.</p>
